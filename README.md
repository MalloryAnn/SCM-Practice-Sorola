## What is SCM?

**Software Configuration Management (SCM)** is the process of systematically organizing, tracking, and controlling changes in software. It ensures that software systems are reliable, consistent, and manageable throughout their development lifecycle. SCM involves version control, change tracking, build management, and more.

## How GitHub Helps with SCM

GitHub is a powerful platform that supports SCM by offering distributed version control through Git. It allows developers to:

- Track and manage changes to code over time.
- Collaborate with others through branches, pull requests, and issues.
- Roll back to previous versions in case of errors or bugs.
- Document progress and track feature development or bug fixes.

By using GitHub, development teams can work more efficiently, avoid conflicts, and maintain a complete history of changes in their codebase.
